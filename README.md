## what is a stamachine

an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

And further:

A state is a description of the status of a system that is waiting to execute a transition.

A state machine is also a visual depiction of such an abstract machine.
